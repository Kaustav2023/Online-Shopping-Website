Online Shopping Project
<br>
Hey! readers
<br>
Me and my team are students of Techno Main Salt Lake and we have built this online shopping website using HTML,CSS,JS and MySql.
Key features of a website like for users to view the home page where all the items that are available and on display categories ranging from 
mobiles to shoes.You can add these products to your cart and if you decide to buy them you can proceed to buy by giving us your address, mobile no.
and payment method.You can even change your profile details and also connect with the admin if you so wish to.<br><br>
Admin can access admin page update the product availability,add new products,delete products from shop and also check messages received from the users
check status for product delivery.Admin has access to the database where he can access user data.
